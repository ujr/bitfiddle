# The Science of the Bit Fiddle

An analysis of Rob Miles's 2016
*Bitshift Variations in C Minor*

Rob created an absolutely fascinating feat: some three
lines of C code that generate an infinite stream of PCM
sound that let you hear four pleasing voices. The work
is aptly named *Bitshift Variations in C Minor*. I found
it most fascinating and just had to do some analysis to
understand the magic.
