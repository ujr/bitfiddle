# The Science of the Bit Fiddle

An analysis of Rob Miles's 2016
*Bitshift Variations in C Minor*

Rob created an absolutely fascinating feat: some three
lines of C code that generate an infinite stream of PCM
sound that let you hear four pleasing voices. The work
is aptly named *Bitshift Variations in C Minor*. I found
it most fascinating and just had to do some analysis to
understand the magic.

## Update January 2025

I came to know that generated sound as the one analyzed
above is known as *bytebeat* and is seen as a kind of
*low-complexity art*. Below are a few entry points.
Rob Miles's *Bitshift Variations* are, in my opinion,
in a somewhat higher league than the samples linked
from the sites below.

- *Discovering novel computer music techniques...* is a short
  paper by Ville-Matias Heikkil√§ (an early bytebeat composer)
  at <http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1368>
- The site <http://canonical.org/~kragen/bytebeat/> compiles
  bytebeat-related links (including to the paper above)
